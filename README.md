# File Converter (fconverter)

**File Converter** (fconverter) is a command line interface (CLI) tool written in Ruby. It allows for the conversion of data files between CSV and JSON formats.

## Installation

To install fconverter, follow these steps:

1. Install gem: `gem install fconverter`

## Usage

After installation, you can use the command `fconverter` in your terminal. To convert a file, use the `convert` command followed by the input file path, the output type ('json' or 'csv'), and the output file path.

To start to the tool you'll need to type: 

`fconverter convert`

Now you'll be asked for the file path you want to convert.

`./path/to/input.csv`

Once this is done, you'll be asked for the target type wanted for the conversion. Just select the one you want.

Last but not least, you'll be asked for the output path wanted. Be careful to enter the good output file name extension.
